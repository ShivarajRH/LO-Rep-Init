				We&#39;re not biased towards full time folds. If you are hungry and humble, we love getting people the experience they need to move along the greatness. Usually though, those people end up staying long term anyway.
			<h3>Life at LyfeOn</h3>
				<h4>Culture</h4>
					<p>We always thought LyfeOn as place that brings together smart, talented people from a diversity of backgrounds where you could bring your whole self to work. You are free to work on the project you like with the team you like. We think employee freedom leads to better productiveness.</p>
				<h4>Benefits</h4>
					<p>When it comes to our benefits and perks, we have everything you&#39;d expect from a company, like health insurance, retirement benefits and so on. But, we also offer more than the basics. Our benefits are part of who we are and they&#39;re designed to take care of the whole you and keep you healthy - physically, emotionally, financially and socially.</br></br>We try to remove as many barriers for our employees as possible so that people can focus on the things they love, both inside and outside of work. At LyfeOn, benefits are an open conversation and your feedback is part of equation.</p>
			<h3>How we hire</h3>
					<p>We are looking for the next member in LyfeOn - someone who is good for the role, good for LyfeOn and good at a lot of things.</br></br>Things move quickly here. At internet speed. That means we have to be nimble, both in how we work and how we hire. We look for people who are great at lot of things, love big challenges and welcome big changes. We can&#39;t have too many specialists in just one particular area. We&#39;re looking for people who are good for LyfeOn not just for now, but for the long term.</br></br>This is the core of how we hire. Our process is pretty basic; the path to getting hired usually involves a first conversation with a recruiter, an onsite interview at our offices with multiple teams and a thought process test to know how you think.</p>
					<h4>Leadership</h4>
						<p>We&#39;ll want to know how you&#39;ve flexed different muscles in different situations in order to solve a problem. This might be by asserting a leadership role at work or with an organization, or by helping a team succeed when you weren&#39;t officially appointed as the leader.</p>
					<h4>Role Related Knowledge</h4> 
						<p>We&#39;re looking for people who have a variety of strengths and passions, not just isolated skill sets. We also want to make sure that you have the experience and the background that will set you up for success in your role. For engineering candidates in particular, we&#39;ll be looking to check out your coding skills and technical areas of expertise.</p>
					<h4>How you think</h4> 
						<p>We&#39;re less concerned about grades and transcripts and more interested in how you think. We&#39;re likely to ask you some role-related questions that provide insight into how you solve problems. Show us how you would tackle the problem presented ; don&#39;t get hung up on nailing the &#39;right&#39; answer.</p>
					<p>At LyfeOn, we don&#39;t just accept difference - we celebrate it, we support it, and we thrive on it for the benefit of our employees, our products and our community. LyfeOn is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer.</p>
